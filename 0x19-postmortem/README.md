**Postmortem: How A Mischievous Load Balancer Played Hooky!**

🚨 🚨 🚨

*Hey fabulous users and spectators of our recent impromptu tech drama, let's dive into a riveting tale of how our web app decided to take an unplanned nap on October 10, 2023!🔥*

---

**🕵️ Issue Summary (A.K.A What in the Web-World Happened?):**

- **Sleepy-Time:** 09:45 AM to 11:30 AM UTC (yes, peak coffee time)
- **Impact:** Our darling web app played "hard to get" with a charming 503 Error, leaving 35% of users bewildered and blue.
- **Root Cause:** A load balancer, which we shall dub Sir Misconfig-a-Lot, forgot how to share and piled all the digital weight onto one server's shoulders!

**Crisis Timeline (An Epic Tale):**

- **09:47 AM:** *“Beep-Boop!”* Our digital sentinels (monitoring systems) screamed!
- **09:50 AM:** Users: "Um, your app is borked." Us: "Oh noes!"
- **09:55 AM:** Engineer Sally rides into battle against the CPU-beast!
- **10:05 AM:** Plot twist: NOT a DDoS attack (Phew and Dang!)
- **10:20 AM:** A wild misdirection appears! (Memory leak theory = Goose chase 🦢)
- **10:40 AM:** Escalation time: Cue the infrastructure ninjas!
- **10:50 AM:** *Aha!* Sir Misconfig-a-Lot, we see your mischievous ways!
- **11:15 AM:** Balancer re-configured, server patted gently.
- **11:30 AM:** Web app awakens! "Did I miss anything?"

**😬 Root Cause and Resolution (A.K.A What Poked The Bear?):**

- **Cause:** Sir Misconfig-a-Lot was spreading love unevenly (heavy traffic to one server, naughty naughty!).
- **Resolution:** Equal love (and user requests) for all servers! And a gentle reboot for the overworked server—she deserves it!

**A Pretty Diagram**:

```plaintext
